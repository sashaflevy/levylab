          Sasha did his undergraduate and Ph.D. research in Molecular and Cell Biology at UC Berkeley and UC Santa Barbara. In 2006, he moved to NYU to become a postdoctoral fellow with <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/siegal/">Mark Siegal</a>. There, he focused on <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060264">robustness</a> and <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001325">bet hedging </a> in yeast. In 2011, he moved to Stanford University for a second postdoc with <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/sherlocklab/">Gavin Sherlock</a>. There he developed a genomic barcoding platform in yeast and used it to study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14279">early clonal dynamics </a> and the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867416310108"> adaptive spectrum</a> in yeast. In 2013, Sasha started his own group at Stony Brook University, which in 2017 moved  to Stanford to become a part of the <a href="http://jimb.stanford.edu/">Joint Initiative for Metrology in Biology</a>. Sasha is interested in developing barcode sequencing as a platform technology, with a specific focus on new tools, methods, and controls that will make bar-seq a low-cost and replicable assay to study a large number of biological questions.

        Darach's first forays into genetics used the haloarchaea NRC-1, 
        first with a comparative genomic approach in the lab of
        Marc Facciotti at UC Davis, then developing Tn-Seq methods with
        Nitin Baliga at the ISB in Seattle. After leaving UC Davis with a
        BS in Genetics, he joined the NYU Biology PhD program 
        to work with David Gresham on measuring
        mRNA destabilization transcriptome-wide during a nitrogen upshift and
        developing new combinations of technologies to directly estimate 
        <i>GAP1</i> mRNA clearance in pools of barcoded mutants.
        At JIMB Darach aims to continue developing and calibrating 
        high-throughput assays to capture the full scope and dynamics of 
        proteome organization in the cell, and to do so in terms relevant to our 
        understanding of the underlying biochemistry.

While working with Sasha, he studied the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14279">lineage dynamics</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867416310108">adaptive spectrum</a>, and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/07/31/170589.full.pdf"> diversity dynamics</a> of clonal evolution in yeast. In 2017, he started his own group at the Cambridge Cancer Centre Early Detection program. His current research interests lie in quantitatively understanding somatic evolution in human tissues and using this understanding to detect cancer earlier.
