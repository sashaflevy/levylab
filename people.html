          Sasha did his undergraduate and Ph.D. research in Molecular and Cell Biology at UC Berkeley and UC Santa Barbara. In 2006, he moved to NYU to become a postdoctoral fellow with <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/siegal/">Mark Siegal</a>. There, he focused on <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060264">robustness</a> and <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001325">bet hedging </a> in yeast. In 2011, he moved to Stanford University for a second postdoc with <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/sherlocklab/">Gavin Sherlock</a>. There he developed a genomic barcoding platform in yeast and used it to study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14279">early clonal dynamics </a> and the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867416310108"> adaptive spectrum</a> in yeast. In 2013, Sasha started his own group at Stony Brook University, which in 2017 moved  to Stanford to become a part of the <a href="http://jimb.stanford.edu/">Joint Initiative for Metrology in Biology</a>. Sasha is interested in developing barcode sequencing as a platform technology, with a specific focus on new tools, methods, and controls that will make bar-seq a low-cost and replicable assay to study a large number of biological questions.

        Takeshi did his undergraduate studies in Biology at Johns Hopkins University. After graduation, he joined Andrew McCallion’s lab as a research technician, where he worked with a team of graduate students and postdocs to identify transcription factor binding site combinations that explain and predict gene expression patterns. In 2011, he joined the University of Southern California Molecular Biology PhD program to work with Ian Ehrenreich. Takeshi’s research in his lab focused on dissecting the genetic architecture of complex traits and studying the background dependence of mutations. As a postdoc in Sasha Levy’s lab, Takeshi is currently developing a high-throughput technique capable of generating extremely large panels of barcoded yeast strains with known genotypes that can be phenotyped simultaneously in cell pools.
